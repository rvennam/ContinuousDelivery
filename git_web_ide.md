# Working with Git in the Eclipse Orion Web IDE
{: #git_web_ide}

You can run many common Git commands in the Eclipse Orion {{site.data.keyword.webide}}.

No matter where you code, you can use this quick reference to do common tasks. When possible, Git commands are shown with their equivalents in the Web IDE.

{: #start_working_on_branch}

### Eclipse Orion Web IDE
1. Click the **Reference** list and expand **local**.
2. Click the checkout icon <img  class="inline" src="./images/checkout.png" alt="Checkout icon"> for the branch to modify.

2. Click **Delete** <img class="inline"  src="./images/delete.png" alt="Delete icon"> for the local branch to remove.

### Git terminal
1. Type `git branch -d <branchname>` and press Enter.

##Force push local changes to a remote branch
{: #force_push}

Overwrite the contents of a referenced remote branch with the contents of your active local branch.

**Important:** When you force push a local branch to a remote one, you might lose commits on the remote branch.

### Eclipse Orion Web IDE

1. In the Working Directory Changes section, select the check box for each file to commit.
3. In the **Enter the commit message** field, type a message that describes your changes.

  **Tip**: Provide a detailed commit message. Your message should provide enough details for someone to understand why the change was necessary without more information.
